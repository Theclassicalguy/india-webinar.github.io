    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Food Of India</h1>
    Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in taste but also in cooking methods. It reflects a perfect blend of various cultures and ages. Just like Indian culture, food in India has also been influenced by various civilizations, which have contributed their share in its overall development and the present form.
    The staple Indian foods are Rice, Wheat and Lentils. And no Indian dish is complete without spices. Indian food is a combination of all six tastes like sweet, sour, salty, bitter, spicy and astringent. In India different dishes are prepared for different festivals. Every festival tends to be complete only when special food associated with that festival is cooked on that day. Like Holi can not be complete without Gujhiya and Eid without Sewai. India is the only country in the world where there is Unity in Diversity not only its culture & religion but also its cuisine.
    Foods of India are better known for its spiciness. Throughout India, be it North India or South India, spices are used generously in food. But one must not forget that every single spice used in Indian dishes carries some or the other nutritional as well as medicinal properties.

        <h3>Adivasi cuisine</h3>
            <p>The unexplored culinary traditions of India's tribal culture, if exposed and adopted could turn our tech driven lifestyle into a healthy, self-sufficient and a minimalistic one.

The Dhurwa tribe of Chhatisgarh relishes chutneys made of red ants, the tribals of Assam gorge onto Eri Polu (stir fried silk worms), the Naga tribes can't get over pork cooked with fermented bamboo shoots with Jolokia chillies and the tribal belt of Jharkhand has contributed the delicious Dhuska (fried pancakes made of lentils and rice) to our Indian cuisine.</p>
